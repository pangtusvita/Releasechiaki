# Releasechiaki
This is a release chiaki of psvita
# Info
I changed key binding `from SCE_CTRL_CIRCLE` to `SCE_CTRL_TRIANGLE` after input connect code
then you can connect to the ps5
just tested on my own psvita.

TODO:
  1. need reconnect with code every time.
  2. very slow when playing games.

Usage:
  1. Install the vpk
  2. Connect the psvita with ps5 in the save network
  3. Start Chiaki
  4. See your PS5 on the list
  5. Select it with up/down/left/right
  6. Cross button to set Connect Code
  7. Triangle Button to set code and go back
  8. Cross Button to Connect To The PS5
  9. OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
